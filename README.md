# Friend Finder

## The Function of This Program
*Friend Finder* is a web application that helps users find their possible best friend by responding to 10 statements. The answers are 1 through 5, 1 being least likely or disagree, and 5 being most likely or agree. The user must also provide their name and a link to an image beforehand. After answering the questions, a modal will pop up displaying a friend from the API database that you are most compatible with.

## The Usefulness
This program utilizes **jQuery**, **node**, and **express** to create a database and link HTML and CSS files. This enables the program to utilize it's internal API and have it updated in realtime until the server is closed.
